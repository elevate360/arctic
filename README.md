The Arctic Theme is built for photographers and designers with a passion for large visual images and detailed posts with elegant typography.

It leverages a fullscreen layout that makes full use of the available real estate so that every pixel has a place.

No expense has been spared on code quality and we believe that this is our best theme yet.
Arctic comes with the ability to have granular control over fonts and post types and can be extended into incredible portfolios.
